            <h1>WELCOME, MUSIC NERDS</h1>
            <p>
                Firstly, let's get rid of all those lame and boring-ass 
                music jargony stuffs <br>which are, mostly, good-for-nothing.<br>
                <br>
                Secondly, at least you gotta <b>write something down</b> although
                you're a dumb-ass nerd<br>
                that somehow bumps into the world of music and now we have 
                to take care of you. <br>You suck, not us.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, this is not an IELTS essay but I just wanna add a third<br>
                idea for the sakes of visual completeness...<br>
                <br>
                <b>Enjoy this sweetness of hell</b>
            </p>

            <h2>WE SERVE WHAT ?</h2>
            <p>
                We don't actually want to educate lazy-ass failures of God or indie-4-laif-2020s,
                but here are something <br>you can eat up (besides your tears) while participating
                in this dungeon of feces:<br>
                <br>
                <h3>ARCHIVE SECTION</h3>
                In this section, you might come across all those familiar music genres... like hell you will.<br>
                A TRUE ARTIST MUST NOT AVOID ANY GENRES OF MUSIC.<br>
                So this is our ultimate collection of artists and genres for you to absorb (Good luck).<br> 
                <br>
                <h3>EDUCATION SECTION</h3>
                Do you want to study some real official hardcore music theories from reliable websites ?<br>
                Do you listen to music 24/7 which equals 3.4285714 hours a day ?<br>
                Are you some kinds of retarded people who actually believe in this sh*t ?<br>
                F*CK YEAH<br>
                <br>
                <h3>EVENTS SECTION</h3>
                Where and when can you attend the music you love ?
                In the coffin at your funeral of course.<br>
                <br>
                <h3>PRODUCTS SECTION</h3>
                Like all other music websites which provides merchandises and practice rooms<br>
                with a fair, reasonable price.<br>
                Of course, with a teeny tiny twist...<br>
                WE ONLY SELL COOCHIES BECAUSE WE NEED MUSIC INSPIRATION<br>

            <h1>ABOUT US <br>(not the one with bankruptcy and racism)</h1>
            <p>
                As a self-learner of music and a person who eats nutrition brick for dinner,<br>
                I find myself qualified enough to tutor our young generation the "baseline"<br>
                of this giant Jazz piece of music (see what I did there).<br>
                <br>
                MIK functions as a provider of music theories I've studied for months, <br>and encourages
                feedbacks and contributions from visitors (it's y'all nuthead). <br>Therefore, these
                theories can be more accurate and applicable to individual's use.<br>
                <br>
                In the following years, our aim is to create an open environment<br>
                of members for interactive forum, call for sponsorship from many sources,<br>
                and impulse social range. What we believe is that any person who has<br>
                a heart and a soul of an artist is a living evidence of futuristic music cultivation<br>
                for the country we represent.<br>
                <br>
